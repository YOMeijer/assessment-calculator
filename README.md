I started width a basic layout for all the buttons and created click functions for them. 
The input and result display in the style guide was somewhat unusual so i started with a more 'classic' single display where either the input or the result would be displayed, depending on what input the user has given. When i got this to work i used the values of this display method and created a second display mode, more in line with the style guide. I had to add a 'memory value' to correctly display the expression when the user would use the previous result in a new expression.

I wanted to have the option to switch between the classic and guideline displays so i created an options screen to switch display modes. Because i made an 'options' screen, which implies multiple options to play with, i also added the modulo mode and HHGTTG mode. Modulo mode will switch the % button form the traditional percentage mode to an extra operator and will give the user the abiltiy to use the modulo operation. The HHGTTG mode should speak for itself. ;)

Lastly i did all the styling. I tried to match the styleguide as close as possible and added some of my own ideas where no specific style was given.
